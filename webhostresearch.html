		<h2><b>My Choice</b>: GoDaddy</h2>
		<p>Though GoDaddy doesn't have the best record when it comes to commericals, they seem to be the best choice for hosting a website due to their low cost and lesser push on what services you can add. BlueHost, and especially Weebly, push their other extentions, tools, and services more than their web hosting services. In addition, Jeff's Party World is a site that can only be hosted by a ludicrously named service like GoDaddy.</p>
