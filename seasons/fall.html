			<p>Fall's signature seasoning is the ever-popular Pumpkin Spice, comprised of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. This warming and comforting blend is usually used in sweeter offerings, such as hot apple cider and pumpkin pie. The savory side of the fall spectrum is lead by rosemary, sage, thyme, and turmeric due to their earthy and complex flavours, not to mention their wide usage across all cultures' foods.</p>
			<p>Breakfasts in fall can range from an herby omlette filled with hearty veggies to a light spiced fruit salad. Lunch falls second to none to roast turkey or roast chicken sandwiches with garlic aoli and thinly sliced veggies. Dinners are where fall's spices really shine, especially in seared steak and mashed potatoes topped with rosemary-garlic butter. Scrumptious!</p>
