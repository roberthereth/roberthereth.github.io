			<p>In winter, the best foods are warming not only to the body, but to the soul. Winter's most popular spices vary from cloves to black pepper, from cinnamon to cardamom. Chili powder of any variety is also popular amongst wintertime meals. Slight spice and comforting warmpth are the most common seasonings for this time.</p>
			<p>During the winter months, oatmeal with cinnamon and dried fruit is a great way to start the day. Wintertime veggies, such as root vegetables, are a great lunch, especially when roasted and topped with a pinch of pepper and garlic powder. Dinner time is easy when you make a full-bodied beef stew filled with winter pizzaz!</p>
