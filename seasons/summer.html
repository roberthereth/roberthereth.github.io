			<p>Summer is fulled with bright herbs and light flavours. Dill, parsley, fennel, and mint lead the green team, while saffron and cumin cover the spice side. Bright colors and sensations fill the air, with sweet and refreshing tastes leading to relaxationa dn fun with family and friends!</p>
			<p>Summertime breakfasts are as simple as can be, with a piece of fruit and a cup of tea or coffee getting you started for the day. Lunch focuses around light veggies and cold sandwiches to help you cool off and refuel midday. Dinner features ribs, seafood, or grilled goodies, all of which benefit from the flavours of the green team!</p>
