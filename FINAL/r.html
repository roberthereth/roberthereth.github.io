				<h1>R Rated Films</h1>
				<p>R rated movies tend to be the most difficult to watch, as many pad out run time with excessive gore, nudity, or swearing. All of the following films are well crafted stories that earn the R rating for their dark tones, disturbing concepts, and plot-essential action. I am also adding the honorable mentions of <i>Deadpool</i> and <i>Deadpool 2</i>, as they are well made action films but can be excessive and pandering at times. I still reccommend the two, but the following six films are truly must-sees.</p>

			<div class="reviews">
				<h2><i>Marriage Story</i></h2>
				<p><i>Marriage Story</i> is the first Netflix original on this list, and for good reason. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver a dark and soul-crushing stoy of a broken family in America that has been widely talked about. The quitness of many scenes and the building tension make this original drama a gripping and enthralling watch. <i>Marriage Story</i> recieved praise and awards, earning my praise after one viewing. Though this film isn't one you'll feel good about at the end, it is a must see for any fans of drama and Adam Driver.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>The Death of Stalin</i></h2>
				<p><i>The Death of Stalin</i> is a period-comedy hybrid. Though the premice sounds boring, <i>The Death of Stalin</i> follows, well, the death of Stalin and the aftermath in the USSR. For any history buffs, this film is a delight, as references are common and always well placed. The comedy persists throughout in a sinister and chuckle worthy way, making this film a fun watch. In addition, the cast makes this story of tragedy and turmoil a must see for fans of history.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>The Art of Self Defence</i></h2>
				<p>This dark comedy is filled with twists and turns. What starts as a humble story of self improvement quickly turns sinsiter the longer the movie goes on. The flat line delivery of Jesse Eisenberg is horribly hilarious and his character fits grimly into the story. Without spoiling anything, this movie can get disturbing and dark at times, so be aware. Other than that, <i>The Art of Self Defence</i> is a well told, dark, comedic, and absurd film that feels surreal and leaves the viewer feeling refreshed.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>The Laundromat</i></h2>
				<p>As the second Netflix orignal movie on this list, <i>The Laundromat</i> tells a captivating story based in reality. The over the top "villans" of the film are a joy to see on screen, and Meryl Streep's performance brings the whole thing together. The light comedy sprinkled throughout, as well as the hyper-realism of this film create a deeply distrubing story thats light-hearted and enjoyable to watch from start to end.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Bad Times at the El Royale</i></h2>
				<p>This stunning thriller, starring Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth, is shot beautifully and brings you back to the late 70's. <i>Bad Times at the El Royale</i> begins by shwoing the meeting of all our characters, slowly moving into their own seperate storylines, all of which come together in a shocking conclusion. The building tension and dread throughout this film is brought together by the great acting and complex characters. <i>Bad Times at the El Royale</i> is one of the best thrillers I have seen, and the soundtrack captures the movie in its entirety. It will easily go down as one of my favorite R rated films of all time.</p>
				<br>
				<h1><b>Overall Favorite</b>: <i>Baby Driver</i></h2>

				</div>
				<p>Edgar Wright's <i>Baby Driver</i> is my favorite R rated movie of all time, and for good reason. All of the performances in this movie, especially those of Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Fox, suck the viewer int othe world of crime. As is usual with Edgar Wright's films, the major plot beats and actions are synced up with this films great soundtrack, making every step and action satisfying to watch. The complexity of the characters, outfits, and music make this action-thriller stand above all others. The scene above captures Wright's work at its finest, making a mundane task one of the most enjoyable scenes in the film. <i>Baby Driver</i> is a movie I can always watch. I never get bored of the action, the characters always win me over, and the story is complex yet clear. Edgar Wright hit it out of the park with this film, earning it my top spot.</p>
