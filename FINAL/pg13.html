				<h2><i>DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story</i></h2>
				<p>The endlessly quotable and hilarious <i>DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story</i> is one of my favorite comedies. The relentless use of humor and slapstick comedy, in addition to one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, instantly shoot this movie into my favorites list. I never shy away from watching the whole film whenever it's on, and I enjoy every minute of it.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Mama Mia!</i></h2>
				<p><i>Mama Mia!</i> is one of my favorite musicals, and the movie does it great justice. The casting of this film, alongside the wonderful music of ABBA and the gorgeous setting, make this a great movie. It's a heartwarming and cheery rom-com musical packed to the brim with style and pizzaz. <i>Mama Mia!</i> will always be one of my favorite musicals of all time, and the movie is always a great way to relive the magic.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i></h2>
				<p>My favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>. The first film is amazing, but <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i> has always felt more grand, more full, and more meaningful. The soundtrack from either of these two films are some of my all time favorites, and the visuals throughout <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i> are absolutely stunning. The wide array of characters and how they become more fleshed out and full throughout the film is great, and the ending brought tears to my eyes. It's a touching movie that balances comedy and storytelling perfectly.</p>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Knives Out</i></h2>
				<p>Rian Johnson's <i>Knives Out</i> is the best whodunnit I have ever seen. The countless plot twists and over the top cast make this film one of my favorites. The costume and set design is impeccable, and the darkly comedic tone are genious. The one thing that holds this film back from being my favorite is the political undertone the whole film has. Though only really prevalent in one scene, I couldn't help but feel robbed at the ending and it's political statement. Other than that, <i>Knives Out</i> will remain one of my favorite films of all time, even if it doesnt age well.</p>
				<br>
				<h1><b>Overall Favorite</b>: <i>La La Land</i></h2>
				<div class="video">
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVVqlm8Fq3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>As you can tell by the six academy awards <i>La La Land</i> won, it's clearly a great film. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone make an unforgettable pair, and their performances are the best from their careers. The scenery and atomasphere are incredably made and depict both of the films worlds perfectly. <i>La La Land</i> draws contrast between the idealistic Hollywood that many dream of and the realistic, soul-crushing world that it is. The opening scene, as seen above, depicts this beautifully and gives a perfect overview of the movie. The chemstry between the two, the original music, and the final twist make this beautiful musical my favorite PG-13 movie.</p>
