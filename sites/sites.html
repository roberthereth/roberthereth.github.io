			<h1>Three Websites: Two Good, One Bad</h1>
		</header>
		
		<section>
			<p>Though simple in appearance, my first good website is <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="new"><u>xkcd.com</u></a>, the home of xkcd’s web comics. The layout and look is simple, but very effective. Every part of the page loads quickly, be it the new comic or even just loading the page for the first time. The color palate is really smooth and soothing, with the font being both highly characteristic and simple at the same time. The rounded corners on the borders, though they use old elements, make the site look modern and well put together. The whole page scrolls with the user, helping the site maintain consistency and a smooth loading. The elements used are HTML5, showing that the site has been updated to work with the times. The navigation on it makes sense and feels nice to traverse. There are primarily three colors on the whole site: light blue, black, and white. Though minimal, they work well together and create an experience that’s easy on the eyes.</p>
			<p>The second good website I want to cover is a promotional site for the movie <a href="https://www.onceuponatimemag.com/" target="new"><u><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></u></a>. This website acts like an online magazine from the late 60’s to fit with the period of the film. Though the website has a lot going on, it still loads fairly quickly, but there is a minor amount of lag between pages. Navigation through the site is a bit slow, but it fits the theming of the page well. The small side links to social media on the right hand side are a nice touch, though they are hard to see on most laptop screens. The custom cursor and background effects on the table of contents page are very smooth looking, but they distract from the main focus and can make the nearby text hard to read. The HTML for the page is difficult to navigate as there are many frames, scripts, and nested items. From a brief overview, the page seems to be running HTML5. The menagerie of pastel colors and muted primaries hives the page both a 70’s and modern feel, only enhanced by the transitions and amoeba-like shapes seen moving on the page. On a more narrow screen, the page becomes buggy, having the cursor work improperly and the page breaking. Aside from some minor issues, this website stands out for numerous reasons: design, creativity, and the sheer amount of effort put into a very under-advertised promotion page.</p>
			<p>The bad website I looked at was the home page for the <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="new"><u>Yale School of Art</u></a>. Coming from Yale, you would expect this page to look professional and fit with their other pages, but it clashes worse than neon green pants with a pastel maroon shirt. The first thing that sticks out is the background: a bright collage of images that don’t fit the screen well and repeat. As the background changes often, the text on the main page is often indistinguishable from the background, and it is usually unreadable. The page looks like someone’s web design assignment to create the worst website possible. The blend of fonts, colors, and unnecessary gradients create something that is truly painful to look at. Though the pages all load fast and are consistent in design, the looks of them are obnoxious and, in multiple cases, use unsupported characters (Note: I am using Chrome). The HTML for the page is in HTML5 and uses nested ‘divs’ to display most of the information, and the code looks neat overall. The navigation is confusing, the images are disruptive, the colors are hard to look at, and the page overall feels like a joke page. This page completely misses its target audience by deterring potential students due to the page’s immature and elementary look and feel.</p>

			That's it. Go home. The article is over. You don't have to be here anymore. Just, just go out that door behind you. Yep, that's the one. See ya. Have a good day. Hasta la vista, baby. Au revoir.
