			<p><b>1</b>: <a href="https://www.tn.gov/" target="_new">Tennessee</a> - 8.5/10</p>
			<p>This website not only loaded the quickest, but had the most easy to navigate layout of all the sites. In addition, the images included and the color pallate made an easy to look at and easy to interact with site. I especialy enjoyed the mild animations on the naviagtion menus, it adds a nice touch and makes the site look cleaner and smoother. All the information I needed was easily accessable through the highly operational search bar, and the links between sites worked fairly well. Thoguh not the best website ever, it is by far the best state website out of this roundup.</p>
			
			<p><b>2</b>: <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/" target="_new">Iowa</a> - 7/10</p>
			<p>Iowa's website clearly goes for a minimalistic/artsy look as seen by it's navigation menus and highly "techy" appearance. This website's appearance hides a muddled search and difficult to use search that, more often then not, feels like something that was required, not something that was wanted. In all, Iowa's color choice is difficult to read in brighter environments, and the unclear contrast of many of the elements made it less enjoyable to navigate. </p>
			
			<p><b>3</b>: <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" target="_new">Vermont</a> - 6/10</p>
			<p>Vermont's large font and elements make it the best site for the hard of sight, but for most citizens looking to learn more about the state, it's a pain to navigate on any device ofther than a TV. Vermont's layout, though not the worst, leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the full screen click navigation blocks. The images included are nothing too special, and the colors feel like they belong in a mean grandma's house. The website is uninspired and feels like a half-done attempt at creating a modern website.</p>
			
			<p><b>4</b>: <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_new">Alaska</a> - 4.5/10</p>
			<p>Alaska's website blinds you with color before you get the chance to look at the information presented. In additon to the sharp transitions, Alaska's website gives off the feeling of an early 2010's pop music video, featuring bright and annoying colors and abrupt cuts between materials. Though the website loaded fairly quickly, the mobile support is poor and the overall composition of the pages are dull and uninspired. This is the bare requirement of a state website, and the only reason that it hasn't been changed since 2008 is becuase nobody can look at it for more than 10 minutes without getting a migrane.</p>
			
			<p><b>5</b>: <a href="https://www.ok.gov/" target="_new">Oklahoma</a> - 3/10</p>
			<p>Oh boy, where to start with this one. Oklahomea's website looks like something that my grandfather would make out of newspaper clippings. The blend of colors, text and images looks like a kindergardener's hand painting attempt. Aside from useless, yet sometimes entertaining, statistics, Oklahoma's website has nothing to offer that a simple Google search couldn't do better at presenting. The webpage took the longest to load and feels like an intern's first project where the employer looks at it and says, "That's ok, you'll do better next time". By far, this website is my least favorite.</p>
